*The Sunken Vale was formerly known as the Mournes of Dónairt, referring to the burial place of the mythic hero who 
served Nuada of the Silver Hand. It is rumoured he was buried with the magical Sword of Light, but his tomb can only 
be opened on the eve of the solstice.*

This is a hexflower-crawl adventure with a celtic/folk horror feel. Suitable for first or second level characters as a 
one-shot or to kick off a new campaign. It is short enough to play in a single session.

Witchbreed of the Sunken Vale was written as part of the Appendix N Game Jam
([Appx. N Jam](https://itch.io/jam/appx-n-jam){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}),
a homage to the retro pulp fantasy literature of Appendix N. Authors were assigned a (made-up) pulp fantasy title and 
riffed off that to write the adventure.

The download includes a screen-formatted PDF (4 pages), a print-formatted PDF (print as a single two-sided page and 
fold to make 4 pages) and a printable player map (1 page). Stats are generic and easily adapted to OSE, DCC, D&D or 
any OSR/retroclone game.

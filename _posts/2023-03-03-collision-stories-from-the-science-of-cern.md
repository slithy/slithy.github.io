![Collision: Stories from the Science of CERN](/assets/images/CollisionCover.png)

A decade after the discovery of the Higgs Boson, the Large Hadron Collider at CERN still leads the world in the search to
uncover what the universe is made of, how it was formed, and what fate may lie in store for it. If there is such a thing
as a "cutting edge", it surely lies 100 metres below the Swiss-French border, at the point where the beams collide.

As part of a unique collaboration, this book pairs a team of award-winning authors with CERN scientists to explore some
of the discoveries being made, through fiction. From interstellar travel using quantum tunnelling, to first contact with
antimatter aliens, to a team of scientists finding themselves being systematically erased from history, these stories
(and their accompanying afterwords) explore the dark matters that only physics can offer answers to. Authors include
*Sherlock* and *Dr Who* writer Steven Moffat, novelist and *Small Axe* screenwriter Courttia Newland, Dame Margaret Drabble
and SF legends Ian Watson (whose credits include the screenplay for Spielberg's *A.I.*) and Stephen Baxter (winner of
the Philip K Dick and John W Campbell Memorial Award).

Michael Davis was paired with author [Pete Kalu](http://www.peterkalu.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} for the story, *Side-channels to Andromeda*.
Afterword by Michael Davis.

The wererat-sorceror Walter Rodemus and his necromantic abomination, the King Rat, were originally created as a
drop-in encounter for [DF23 The Haunted Keep](https://www.dragonsfoot.org/files/pdf/DF23-The-Haunted-Keep.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

Published in *Footprints* magazine (issue 19) and reprinted in the *Footprints Compendium of Monsters*.

*Like the other Rodemuses, Walter is a wererat. He is the most hideous of his clan and will always be
encountered in rat-man form. He wears decaying robes—made of once-fine velvet, trimmed with giant ferret pelt—and
exudes an unhealthy stink of urine and decayed flesh. He wears a gold medallion with an embossed image of a rat
skull on it.*

*Walter has been engaged in a project to create an unspeakable horror, a King Rat. His daemonical experiments
have summoned evil spirits into nine rats which have swollen to prodigious size.*

*The King Rat is a crawling abomination created by intertwining the tails of 1d6+1 Monstrous Rats, 2d6 Giant Rats
and 3d6 normal rats. The necromantic ritual which creates the King Rat unites them into a hive mind with increased
intelligence and psionic abilities.*

![If you go down to the woods today, C&C forest encounters in Crusader Journal 20](/assets/images/Wasp.png)

Published in Crusader Journal issue 20:

*A pre-generated encounter that the Castle Keeper can use to add excitement to a journey through a forest or woods.
This encounter should prove challenging for a group of low/mid-level characters (levels 3-5).*

*As the party are making their way through a forest or wood, they catch sight of a curious structure. It looks like

*"If You Go Down the Woods Today ..." C&C Forest Encounters by Michael Davis. This article is as fun to read as those old
"Ecology of ..." articles in Dragon magazine but also is a full fledged encounter (for levels 3-5) you can stick in your
game anytime somebody goes into the woodline for something. And you get a brand new monster!*

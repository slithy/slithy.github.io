*The viol's melody filled the air with an inexpressible sweetness and longing, the
final notes lingering after the musician's hand became still. Finnigan the bard
appreciated the few seconds of silence before the audience in the Black Lobster
broke into thunderous applause. Taking his bow, the bard sat down with a
satisfied smile.*

*"Aye, she may seem serene from afar, lad," said a gruff voice at his elbow.
Finnegan turned his head. The old sea-dog paused to wipe some foam from his
grizzled beard before continuing. "Mark my words, she's as capricious as the sea
herself. The Mistress of Storms, she is, you'd do well to remember it." Finnigan
stared. The old man dropped his voice to a throaty whisper. "And then there's
the lunacy, in't there? Don't you forget the moon what controls the tides is the
same what drives men mad."*

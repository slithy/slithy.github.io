![Dungeon Crawl Classics Horror: Return of the Ripper Cover](/assets/images/ReturnOfTheRipperCover.png)

*Death stalks the streets of Spittle-Fields — an elusive killer committing horrible crimes. A century past, dread 
gripped the teeming slum of the Tenements. Women were savagely murdered by a shadowy figure who vanished into the fog. 
Then the murders stopped, but the killer was never found.*

*Now a fresh murder awakens fears that the Ripper has returned. The party must search for answers in Spittle-Fields 
Market, through the narrow alleys of the Tenements, in the haunted Ten Bells, within the sinister White Chappel and 
down into the sewers which carry all the filth from the city above.*

Return of the Ripper is an urban horror investigation adventure for Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG, set in Spittle-Fields, 
an insalubrious city district that has bloomed beyond Punjar's Plague Gate.

The four quarters of Spittle-Fields are presented as an urban sandbox populated with nearly 200 detailed locations, 
populated by an array of grotesque NPCs. The adventure contains fourteen maps illustrating the four quarters of 
Spittle-Fields: Spittle-Fields Union Workhouse, the Cam Inn, Mitre Tavern, the haunted Ten Bells Public House, the 
Guildhall of Master Builders and the mysterious the White Chappel.

The adventure continues beneath the city streets in the crypts and tunnels beneath the churchyard and along the rivers,
channels and sewers of the Undercity — and an expedition into a lost realm in a hidden pocket dimension.

Return of the Ripper is intended to be played as a mini-campaign, taking characters from 1st to 3rd level — and beyond.
Spittle-Fields can also be used as an urban decay campaign setting and contains many adventure hooks for the Judge to 
develop further.

This product is compatible with the Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game.

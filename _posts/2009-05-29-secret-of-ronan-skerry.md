*The town of Port Vogey is in distress. For several weeks, no ships have come into port, and noone knows why. Now the new
moon has passed and the lighthouse keepers, the monks of a local Sea Goddess, have missed their monthly trip into Vogey
for supplies. The town council is not sure whether this is due to mishap or foul play, but you have heard they are looking
for some eager adventurers to investigate.*

This 20-page full-sized module was written for the Castles & Crusades role-playing game. It is a short scenario which can
be run during the course of a session or two. The module includes four maps for the encounter areas and the surrounding
wilderness and four new Creatures for Castles & Crusades.
